## Description

This application is an example of a potential website overhaul for a charitable organzation. The project is built in React and utilizes Google's Firebase technology as well as the Stripe payment API. Users can enter there information into a contact form which is validated before being sent off to a Firestore database. Users can also access a donation modal on any page of the website that uses Stripe to process user payments.

## Purpose

I decided to create this project after I read the novel "Mountains Beyond Mountains" by Tracy Kidder. I was extremely interested in the work of the Partners in Health charity and decided to create a sort of redesign for their website. The website design is based off of another personal project I found online that can be found here at https://concordehaiti.com/. I used this project as real world practice for recreating a given design with my own code and added to the original design by making a responsive mobile version as well as integrating payment into the website..

## Technologies

React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, Custom useContact Hook

React Packages: React-router, react-currency-format

Google's Firebase(NoSQL database program): Firestore Database to save submitted contact fields

Material-Ui: Used for the icons on the website

Stripe API: Used for payment processing

Node.js: Simple express server create to assist with Stripe payments

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
